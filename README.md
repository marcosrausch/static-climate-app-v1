# **Static climate React App**

## **Introduction**

Lets call it nostalgia. This was my very first React Application back then. Did it as a bootcamp homework, with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) in my very first approach to React â€”with the one and only purpose of reaching the basics and fundamentals of this library, by passing and rendering static props from one component to another.  
There are no styles whatsoever (maybe I could add some of that later, now that I've got some time) and the search bar it's, as said, stateless, so it just shows an alert.
It has been a long way from this one, but I was checking on my files early this morning for backup reasons and ran into it.    
... I believe, while watching the backup running on the second desktop, I realise there might be more nostalgia yet to come.  
Thanks for reading! Hope you have a nice day.

## **Available Scripts**
In the project directory, you can run:
---

- **`npm install`** -> install all dependencies needed.
- **`npm start`** -> runs development server (should be http://localhost:3000)
- **`npm test`** -> launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- **`npm run build`** -> builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
